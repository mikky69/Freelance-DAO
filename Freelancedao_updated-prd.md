## 1. Executive Summary
FreelanceDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform designed to revolutionize freelancing by connecting clients with freelancers, AI agents, and hybrid teams in a transparent, blockchain-powered ecosystem. The platform supports human-led teams, AI-only teams, and hybrid (human + AI) teams, enabling flexible collaboration for projects of all sizes.

Key goals:
- Facilitate seamless hiring and workflow management for clients.
- Empower freelancers and AI creators with tools to showcase skills, set fees, and earn royalties.
- Govern the platform through community-driven proposals and dispute resolution.
- Promote hybrid innovation by allowing institutions and studios to register as hybrid teams.

**Target Users**:
- **Clients**: Businesses or individuals seeking services (e.g., web design, content creation).
- **Freelancers**: Independent professionals offering human expertise.
- **AI Creators**: Developers launching trainable AI agents for tasks.
- **Hybrid Teams**: Studios, labs, or institutions combining human and AI talent.
- **DAO Members**: Token holders participating in governance.

**Platform URL**: [freelancedao.xyz](https://freelancedao.xyz)

**Rebranding Notes**: 
- Color Scheme: Primary - Deep Purple (#6A0DAD); Secondary - Vibrant Orange (#FF6B35); Accent - Soft Magenta (#E91E63). Updated from previous blue/white scheme to evoke innovation, energy, and creativity.
- Logo: Stylized "Φ" (Phi) symbol representing collaboration and phi (golden ratio) for balanced design.

4. Key Features and Workflows
The platform is divided into three main navigation sections: Work, Hire, and Govern. Below, we outline core workflows with visual aids in mind (e.g., flowcharts for designers).

4.1 Work Section (For Freelancers, AI Creators, Hybrid Teams)
This section allows providers to manage profiles, showcase services, and engage in projects.

- Profile Registration:
  - Freelancers: Upload portfolio, skills, rates.
  - AI Creators: Add AI agents (description, capabilities, limitations, usage fees, royalty %).
  - Hybrid Teams: Register as institutions/studios/labs. Include team members (humans + AI agents), specialties (e.g., full-stack web dev: UI/UX, frontend, backend), capacity, and pricing models.
  - Workflow: User selects type (Human Team / AI Team / Hybrid) → Fill form → Verify via wallet connect → Profile live.

- AI Agent Marketplace:
  - A dedicated subsection for browsing/hiring AI agents.
  - Creators list agents with: Name, Description (e.g., "AI Copywriter for marketing"), Limitations (e.g., "No legal advice"), Fee structure (per task/hour), Royalties (e.g., 10% on resales).
  - Clients search/filter by task type → Hire instantly or integrate into hybrid teams.
  - Workflow: Creator uploads → Moderation (light review) → Listed → Client hires → Agent executes → Payment split (client pays fee; creator gets royalty).

- Job Bidding and Collaboration:
  - Providers bid on client postings or form ad-hoc teams.
  - Supports hybrid formations: E.g., Freelancer + AI Agent.
  - Visual Aid for Designers: Use swimlane flowchart showing Client Post → Bid Review → Team Assembly → Milestone Tracking.

4.2 Hire Section (For Clients)
Focus on discovering and engaging teams.

- Team Discovery:
  - Browse by type: Human Teams, AI Teams, Hybrid Teams.
  - Filters: Skills, Budget, Location (decentralized, so wallet-based), Ratings.
  - UI Element: Circular avatar carousel (as in brief image) showing diverse team icons (human photos, AI avatars, hybrid blends).

- Project Posting and Hiring:
  - Post RFP with scope, budget, timeline.
  - Receive proposals from individuals/teams.
  - Hire via smart contract escrow.
  - Workflow: Post Job → Review Bids → Select Team (e.g., Creative Studio for website: auto-assigns UI/UX, devs) → Onboard → Track via dashboard → Release funds.

- Project Management:
  - Real-time collaboration tools (integrated chat, milestone gates).
  - AI-assisted: Agents handle routine tasks (e.g., code generation).

4.3 Govern Section (DAO Governance)
Newly added for community-driven decision-making. Accessible to FLDAO token holders.

- Proposals:
  - Major Proposals: For significant changes (e.g., protocol upgrades, fee adjustments). Requires quorum vote; if passed, auto-implemented via governance contracts.
  - Light Proposals: For minor tweaks (e.g., UI updates, feature requests). Faster voting; manual implementation by core team.
  - Workflow: Member submits (title, description, vote options) → Discussion period → Vote (quadratic/1-token-1-vote) → Execution.

- Dispute Resolution:
  - Handles conflicts between clients and freelancers/hybrid teams (e.g., scope creep, quality issues).
  - Workflow: Party submits dispute (evidence upload) → Arbitrator pool (staked members) reviews → Vote on resolution (refund, rework) → Enforced via escrow.

- Staking:
  - Users stake FLDAO tokens to participate in governance, earn rewards, or signal commitment.
  - Slashing for bad actors in disputes.
  - Workflow: Connect wallet → Stake amount → Lock period → Delegate to pools if desired.

- DAO News:
  - Feed of updates: Proposal outcomes, platform announcements, community highlights.
  - Integrated with X/Discord for real-time alerts.
  - UI Element: Timeline view with purple/orange accents for categories (Proposals in orange, News in purple).
