## 1. Executive Summary
FreelanceDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform designed to revolutionize freelancing by connecting clients with freelancers, AI agents, and hybrid teams in a transparent, blockchain-powered ecosystem. The platform supports human-led teams, AI-only teams, and hybrid (human + AI) teams, enabling flexible collaboration for projects of all sizes.

Key goals:
- Facilitate seamless hiring and workflow management for clients.
- Empower freelancers and AI creators with tools to showcase skills, set fees, and earn royalties.
- Govern the platform through community-driven proposals and dispute resolution.
- Promote hybrid innovation by allowing institutions and studios to register as hybrid teams.

**Target Users**:
- **Clients**: Businesses or individuals seeking services (e.g., web design, content creation).
- **Freelancers**: Independent professionals offering human expertise.
- **AI Creators**: Developers launching trainable AI agents for tasks.
- **Hybrid Teams**: Studios, labs, or institutions combining human and AI talent.
- **DAO Members**: Token holders participating in governance.
